<p>This is a diary. I'm also gonna use this to practise writing code and to demonstrate all I've learned.</p>

<p>I didn't do anything today as well.</p>
<p>I'm working part time in a bar in Kilburn for some really nice people so I asked them for some extra hours. It turns out that some of the persons on the team ended up quitting which makes me very uneasy.</p>
<p>This is the location of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Shop+NW10/@51.5338175,-0.2208624,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48761038db49fd53:0x9c547d2c89150a37!8m2!3d51.5338142!4d-0.2186737" target="_blank">bar</a>.</p>

<p> Month end as always been a frustrating time for me, mostly because I have to pay my phone bill which I already did.</p>
<p>I'm getting the opportunity to work more hours at <b>The Shop</b> starting from next week but it's making me kind of uneasy. I wonder if the bar will do well or if I will do well. If this fails then there's nothing else for me.</p>
<p>Yesterday a film freelancer by the name of Elana Seyes reached out to me and offered me a job as a Production Assistant.
    I don't know if she contacted me for that reason in mind but it's kind of nice. This would be good for me. She sent me a link to the Instagram page.
    It's called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/creativeswanted/" target="_blank">Creatives Wanted</a>. I'll do research on it later.</p>
